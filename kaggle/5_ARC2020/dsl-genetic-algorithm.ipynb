Our *elites* can be understood as an approximation of the pareto surface (collection of pareto optimal solution). In our specific case, when a solution to the task exists in our DSL, their exists a global minimum that will be smaller than any candidate. In a such case the pareto surface is reduced to a single point. Nethertheless, this is a good image to keep in mind to understand what the collection of *elites* represent."

On machine learning it is common to minimise a distance wereas in genetic algorithm literature you can read that we maximize the fitness of an agent^1. Both convention work perfectly, but it is more convenient if we choose one and stick to it. Therefore, we will MINIMIZE the score of our programs.\n",
